ALL DATA COMMITTED TO FRONT END IS PUBLIC!

For Devs:

- there is mock data, simply create .env.local with REACT_APP_DEV_MODE=false
- Or run netlify dev (for severless functions to get actual data - some functions still fail e.g. google drive)

// future to do if you cba:

- clean up deleted refrenced images in front end config
- include event time tables???
- check mutli sessions works fine
- stress test, put text limit caps on inputs

add mLH toggle asnd scheudles to event
